## Overview 
The Garden Project is a community-driven app designed to mitigate food insecurity in West Louisville, a designated food desert. The app encourages residents to buy locally from community gardens and organizations, helping to promote local agriculture and support the community. 

## Features
**Interactive Map**: Displays the locations of community gardens and local organizations in West Louisville using the Google Maps API. 

**Garden Details**: Each garden listed comes with a description of the organization or individual running it, along with the produce that can be found at those specific locations.

**Healthy Recipes**: Offers a curated selection of healthy recipes aligned with the produce available at these gardens and local grocery stores, encouraging healthy eating habits. 

## Purpose
This project was created to inspire community engagement and provide residents with resources to access fresh, local produce. By encouraging people to buy locally, the app aims to address food insecurity and promote wellness through healthier food choices.

## Technologies Used
Google Maps API - Vue.js - JavaScript - HTML/CSS - Express.js - PostgreSQL

## How to Use 
1. Explore the map to find nearby community gardens.
2. Click on a garden to learn more about its location and the organization behind it.
3. Browse the healthy recipes section for meal ideas that match available local produce. 

## Future Enhancements
Adding user accounts to track favorite gardens and save recipes.  Integrating a community volunteer page and the ability to sign up for notifications about farmers markets. This project is a labor of love for my community, and I hope it helps to make a positive impact by improving access to fresh, nutritious food.
